An app for gentle morning routine reminders and weather advices
# NOTE! API key for OpenWeather API is NOT included

For those who want to be fully prepared for a new day. 
User makes a list of morning routine things (eg. "brush my teeth", "Feed the cat", "Take the car keys")
and marks them "done" before leaving home
After completing all the tasks, the app gives a friendly, weather-based advice
(again, OpenWeather API key is needed)
